- [X] Default options
    - Which is overwritten if `options/user_options` is found inside of the user folder

- [ ] Setup basic keymaps

- [ ] Setup LSP
    - Going to use `lsp-zero` for this

## Further Config Setup
- Look for additional `user.*` files
 - `user.plugins`
    - Disable preinstalled and install new plugins
 - `user.colorscheme`
    - Allow user override default scheme if colorscheme has a `set` key
 - `user.keymaps`
    - Should override existing keys, but warn user they are being overriden once
